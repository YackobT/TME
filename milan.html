      <h2>Architectural Icons</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Duomo di Milano</strong> took nearly six centuries to build,
        beginning in 1386 and finishing in the 20th century. Its façade blends
        Gothic, Renaissance and Neoclassical elements, crowned by forest of
        spires, flying buttresses and gargoyles. Covering 126,000 square feet,
        the cathedral can hold up to 40,000 worshippers and features 3,159
        statues, including the gilded <em>Madonnina</em> atop the main spire.
      </p>

      <h2>Shopping & Symbolism</h2>
      <p>
        Adjacent to the cathedral, the <strong>Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II</strong>
        is a 19th‑century shopping arcade enclosed by a soaring glass and iron
        roof. Designed by Giuseppe Mengoni and built between 1865 and 1867, the
        gallery connects Piazza del Duomo to Piazza della Scala through a
        cruciform passage crowned by a 47 metre dome.
        Patriotic mosaics on the floor depict the coats of arms of Italian cities;
        stepping on the bull of Turin is believed to bring good luck.
      </p>

      <h2>Masterpiece of the Renaissance</h2>
      <p>
        Milan is home to Leonardo da Vinci’s <strong>Last Supper</strong>. Painted
        between 1494 and 1498 on the refectory wall of Santa Maria delle
        Grazie, this mural depicts the moment Jesus announces a betrayal. Its
        innovative composition captures the disciples’ emotions and is widely
        regarded as one of the most important works of the Renaissance.
        The painting and convent are UNESCO World Heritage sites, highlighting
        their universal value.
